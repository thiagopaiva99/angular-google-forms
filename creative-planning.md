# Angular Google Forms
## Creative Planning

### Synthesis of the Idea

Collecting data is critical to analyzing the desires and experiences of customers and leads, a good way to do this is through a form where those customers and leads can answer questions that demonstrate their opinions.

Angular Google Forms is a Web APP that allows you to perform these data collections through highly customizable forms.

The steps for the collection are, the user creates a customizable form on the platform and sends a special collection link to the search targets, which in turn respond to the form and instantly the form's creator can see all the responses received.
